# 👋 Hi, I'm Dima Abramovich

I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that empower developers and scale across complex architectures.  
With deep experience in AI agents, code generation, and developer tooling, I’ve led and contributed to products used by millions — from cloud-native SaaS platforms to fully isolated on-prem solutions.

I focus on bridging deep technical complexity with simple, effective user experiences.  
My work spans B2B and B2C environments, with a strong emphasis on delivering practical, high-impact solutions — often built with technologies like **Rust** and **Node.js**.
