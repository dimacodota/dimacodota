## 👋 About Me

I'm passionate about building **intelligent systems** that **empower developers** and scale across complex architectures.  
With deep experience in **AI agents**, **code generation**, and **developer tooling**, I've led and contributed to products used by millions — from **cloud-native SaaS** platforms to fully isolated **on-prem** solutions.

I specialize in **developer experience** and **IDE integration**, with deep expertise in delivering advanced capabilities across modern IDEs — including **Visual Studio Code**, **IntelliJ**, and others.  
I have a strong understanding of **code relationships**, **Language Server Protocols (LSPs)**, and **code search systems**, enabling smarter, faster developer workflows.

My background spans both **B2B** and **B2C** environments, with a strong focus on delivering **practical, high-impact solutions** — often built with **Rust**, **Node.js**, and **React**.
